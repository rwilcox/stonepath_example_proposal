== stonepath_test

This Rails project was generated via the Bundler template
(see <http://tomafro.net/2009/11/a-rails-template-for-gem-bundler>), and shows off
stonepath (<http://github.com/bokmann/stonepath/>).

== The Scenario, as Agile requirements

As a user I should be able to add a new Proposal to the System
As an administrator I should be able to assign a Proposal to an Organization for acceptance or kickback.
As an Organization I should be able to accept or kickback the Proposal (a kickback would be passed back to the Administrator)
As a user I should be able to see the status of the proposal's work items

== The Scenario, in programmer talk

I am testing out stonepath, to make sure I understand how to model Work Items
(the Proposal), creating a Task based off these work items, and that these Tasks
can be passed back and forth from one Work Bench to another.

This scenario is very loosely modeled on some work done by WD-rpw in March 2009, in Hong Kong China.
